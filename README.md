# Url-classification-Prediction-Model-
Malicious URL, a.k.a. malicious website, is a common and serious threat to cyber-security. Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by downloads, etc.) and lure unsuspecting users to become victims of scams (monetary loss, theft of private information, and malware installation), and cause losses of billions of dollars every year. It is imperative to detect and act on such threats in a timely manner. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through the usage of blacklists. However, blacklists cannot be exhaustive, and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This project aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. i present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.).
